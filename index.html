        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this <b>AMAZING</b> website, where you can buy more <b>RAM!</b><br>

        <h2>Common asked questions:</h2>
        <h3>What is RAM you might ask?</h3>
        <p>well RAM is actually an acronym, it stands for <mark><u>Random Access Memory</u></mark></p>

        <h3>What is RAM used for?</h3>
        <p>When you open a program such as Microsoft Word, the computer loads the application into<br>
            its RAM. When you open a document that you already have saved on your computer, <br>
            the operating system finds the file in long-term storage and copies the information <br>
            into its RAM. These are used for everything on your computer, I mean <mark><b><u>EVERYTHING.</u></mark></b>
        </p>

        <h3>CPU vs RAM: which is more important?</h3>
        <p>
            So while both are important when it comes to optimizing your computer's performance, <br>
            upgrading or overclocking your processor provides more processing power when your processor is<br> 
            pushed to its limits, allowing you to run more resource-intensive programs and achieve more. <br>
            On the other hand, increasing RAM capacity will, above all, enable faster and more complex processes.

        <h3>Are there different types of RAM?</h3>
        <p>
            The currently most popular type of RAM is DDR-SDRAM, a synchronous dynamic random access memory<br>
            with twice the data transfer rate. DDR (double data rate) allows multiple files to be transferred <br>
            at the same time. The latest version of DDR5 RAM can achieve a data transfer speed of about 6.4 <br>
            gigabytes per second.However, supply chain bottlenecks make obtaining DDR5 memory difficult and <br>
            very expensive. The most commonly used RAM remains DDR4, which also comes in many types and speeds. <br>
            Typically, these memory cards operate at speeds of 2400 MHz or higher. Video RAM is even faster <br>
            than regular memory and typically comes in the form of GDDR (Graphics Double Data Rate), <br>
            a special type of memory optimized for graphics playback. The latest generation – GDDR6 – can <br> 
            achieve data transfer speeds of 16 Gbit/s.

        <h3>How much memory do I need?</h3>
        <p>
            The more RAM your computer has, the faster it runs. If your device is old, you might need <br>
            to upgrade the RAM or other hardware. Every open application (including browser tabs) <br>
            consumes RAM. When you run out of RAM, your computer has to move things around to free <br>
            up space on the hard disk, which slows down your computer. The amount of RAM you need <br>
            depends on the apps and programs you use, how many of them you have open at the same time, <br> 
            and how impatient you are.

        <h3>How much RAM do you need?</h3>
        <p>Generally, users recommend 8GB of RAM for casual computer usage and internet browsing, <br>
            16GB for spreadsheets and other office programs, and at least 32GB for gamers and <br>
            multimedia creators. How you use your computer influences how much RAM you need, <br>
